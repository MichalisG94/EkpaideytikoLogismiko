8th semester final Android assignment.

The App is an online platform designed to help teachers teach a course and have direct contact with their students. 

There are three kind of users, a teacher, a student and a visitor.
Each user has to login in order to use the app. 
If the user is neither a teacher nor a student, he can continue as a guest/visitor.
The guest can only read the theory of the course.

The teachers can present the theory of their course, add questions and make quizzes to test the progress of each student, 
communicate in real time with the students through a forum-like section, edit their profile by adding a picture and some personal information
search and see student profiles.

The students can read the theory of the course, solve quizzes with questions from each section of the theory or from all the sections together,
rate both the theory and quiz sections, communicate with the professor, edit their profile and search for other profiles too.
